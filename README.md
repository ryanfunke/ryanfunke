Hi, I'm Ryan Funke -- an undergraduate student at Purdue University studying Cybersecurity and Industrial Engineering.

Iâ€™m interested in Cybersecurity, Software Engineering and Data Science; the contents of these repositories range from exercises and assignments from my studies to personal projects.

Iâ€™m currently learning about network administration and common threats in Cybersecurity, but I love to push myself and learn new skills that assist me to code smarter, not harder.
